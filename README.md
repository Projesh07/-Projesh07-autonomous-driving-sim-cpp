  For my bottom-up implementation I ma starting with parallel programing 

## Using Intel OpenMP parallel programming 
  * What is parallel computing 
  * - In parallel programming, tasks are parallelized so that they can be run at the same time by using multiple computers or multiple cores within a CPU. 
  * - Parallel programming is critical for large-scale projects in which speed and accuracy are needed. 
  * - It is a complex task but allows developers, researchers, and users to accomplish research and analysis quicker than with a program that can only process one task at a time
  * Multiprocessing means: 
  * - Having a processor with multiple cores or sub-processor in a package 
  * - Where every single core can execute multiple threads
  * - Each thread contains one or more CPU instructions (for instance # MOV  or AND instruction) 
  * Letâ€™s understand your computer: 
  *  - My one is Amd ryzen 7 5800x
  *  - Power up your computing experience with the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 3.8 GHz Eight-Core AM4 Processor,
  *  - Which features eight cores and 16 threads for each core to help quickly load and multitask demanding applications at a single time.
  *  - For better understanding please have a look at the image where I have marked my computer configuration 
  *  - You can do yours by going to Task manager -> To perfromance -> select CPU
